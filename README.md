## Features

### Language Support and Completion

_powed by lsp-zero_

#### Keybindings

Completion Menu:

* <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Confirms selection.

* <kbd>Up</kbd>: Navigate to previous item on the list.

* `<Down>`: Navigate to the next item on the list.

* `<Ctrl-u>`: Scroll up in the item's documentation.

* `<Ctrl-f>`: Scroll down in the item's documentation.

* `<Ctrl-e>`: Toggles the completion.

* `<Ctrl-d>`: Go to the next placeholder in the snippet.

* `<Ctrl-b>`: Go to the previous placeholder in the snippet.

* `<Tab>`: Enables completion when the cursor is inside a word. If the completion menu is visible it will navigate to the next item in the list.

* `<S-Tab>`: When the completion menu is visible navigate to the previous item in the list.


LSP:

* `K`: Displays hover information about the symbol under the cursor in a floating window. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.hover()`.

* `gd`: Jumps to the definition of the symbol under the cursor. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.definition()`.

* `gD`: Jumps to the declaration of the symbol under the cursor. Some servers don't implement this feature. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.declaration()`.

* `gi`: Lists all the implementations for the symbol under the cursor in the quickfix window. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.implementation()`.

* `go`: Jumps to the definition of the type of the symbol under the cursor. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()`.

* `gr`: Lists all the references to the symbol under the cursor in the quickfix window. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.references()`.

* `<Ctrl-k>`: Displays signature information about the symbol under the cursor in a floating window. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()`. If a mapping already exists for this key this function is not bound.

* `<F2>`: Renames all references to the symbol under the cursor. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.rename()`.

* `<F4>`: Selects a code action available at the current cursor position. See `:help vim.lsp.buf.code_action()`.

### Diagnostics

powered by trouble.nvim

- `gl`: Show diagnostics in a floating window. See :help vim.diagnostic.open_float().
- `[d`: Move to the previous diagnostic in the current buffer. See :help vim.diagnostic.goto_prev().
- `]d`: Move to the next diagnostic. See :help vim.diagnostic.goto_next().


### Splitting and Joining lines

- `gS`: change from one-line syntax to multi-line syntax
- `gJ`: change from multi-line syntax to one-line syntax

### Misc:

* `ga`: show info about the character under cursor as decimal, octal, and hex (_powered by vim-characterize_)
